	Foreword
	========

This is the code of HiBase as it was on 31.5.1998 but so that all such
code has been removed, which was either written by a Nokia employee or
which somehow possibly related to trade secrets or benchmarks
specified by Nokia.  `Makefile.in', `cells-def.h', `shades.c',
`tagged.c', `cells.c' and `text_access_method.c' have been edited
accordingly.  Only a handful of changes (see `ChangeLog') have been
made to this distribution since.  

This code, except for the omissions described above and this Foreword
to this README file and the LICENSE-file, is identical to the one used
in the Intelligent Networks benchmark mentioned in Kenneth Oksanen's
Licentiate's Thesis.  The code for the other benchmarks in the Thesis
is newer and not yet included in this first public release.  Most
notably, this release does not contain the Nolang/Shines compiler and
its libraries, graphical user interfaces etc.  We have the right to
release the full version of HiBase under GPL after a two year
quaranteen in the fall of 2002.  The same release will most likely
also contain a dual-licensed reimplementation of Shades intended for
64-bit computers.

	Introduction
	============

Shades is a recovery method for a main memory database system, and
consequently also the name of the whole main memory database server
program.

The main features of Shades are:
  o  full ACIDity (not all of ACID yet implemented),
  o  high performance 
     (16090 TPC-B-like transactions per second with a 10 tps database
     on a 180 MHz Pentium Pro),
  o  real-time compacting garbage collection,
  o  byte code interpreter with continuation passing style (first-class
     continuations),
  o  replication (not included in at least this GPL-distribution).


	The HiBase-project
	------------------

Shades was developed and implemented in the HiBase-project, a joint
effort between the Laboratory of Information Processing Science and
Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), and Nokia Telecommunications
(NTC).  The project started in 1996 was aborted in 2001.

	Installation
	============

	Prerequisites
	-------------

Probably most UNIX-like operating systems will do.  Required features
are:
  o  a 32-bit unsigned integer type,
  o  at least 32-bit default pointer types,
  o  ANSI C.

Appreciated, but not strictly necessary features are:
  o  the GNU C-compiler,
  o  asynchronous IO (currently POSIX.4 and Solaris `aiowrite's
     supported) or alternatively POSIX.4 pthreads,
  o  an efficient raw-device interface.

Since Shades is a main memory database, you probably want a machine
with a reasonable amount of RAM and a rather capable disk.  The
smallest databases we have tried are as small as 8MB.  The largest
databases have been around 100MB, but probably much larger databases
behave just as well.

Some rather machine-specific optimizations have been done for Alpha
and Sparc processors when compiled with GNU C.  See the early lines in
file `shades.h'.

Media recovery (mirroring) and replication have not yet been
implemented, but if you eventually wish to try out those features, you
should have two disks for mirroring and two machines with same
endianness and a fast interconnection for replication.


	Compiling Shades
	----------------

Shades has been developed to use GNU autoconf.  Therefore it should
suffice to issue
	./configure
	make
and then with sufficient privileges
	make install
on practically any UNIX-like platform.  If configure complains about a
failing C compiler, you can tell it to use another one with `CC=mycc
./configure'.  If it complains about a lacking either GNU or BSD make
but you have installed GNU make with the name `gmake', issue
`MAKETYPE=GNU ./configure'.

If you don't give configure any arguments, it compiles a debugging
version of Shades for use in the development process.  The debugging
version is heavily loaded with asserts, so if you want high
performance, you should give the argument `--enable-speed' and
additionally `--enable-async-io' for asynchronous IO.  Issue
`./configure --help' for a list of all options.  Note that the default
installation directories are `/usr/local/hibase/{bin,lib,include,doc}'.

Some site-specific problems we have encountered:
  alpha-dec-osf4.0 with native compiler: You can't have asynchronous
    IO without `--enable-speed'.  The reason is that in the
    `AC_CHECK_LIB' for `-laio' the linker fails if it is given any
    debugging flags (e.g. `-g'), which is the case unless you have
    `--enable-speed'.
  alpha-dec-osf4.0: Considerable unreliability with the
    POSIX.4-compliant asynchronous writing.  Use the pthreads-version
    instead.
  linux (2.0.30): When using pthread-based asynchronous IO the kernel
    tends to swap out the shades-process instead of shrinking
    buffer caches. We fixed this by adding a minute patch to the
    kernel in file `mm/vmscan.c' in function `swap_out' in order to
    prevent any shades process to be swapped out.  A corresponding fix
    will hopefully be present in newer kernels, but if not, then
    contact <cessu@iki.fi> for more information on the patch.

Probably you can't cross-compile Shades as it currently has been
written.  Even if all of `autoconf.in's tests could be cross-compiled,
some cpp-level tests in `insn-def.h' might not cross-compile correctly
(see `TAGGED_TO_SIGNED_WORD').

You can instruct Shades to use a different "page size" with
`--enable-page-size=X' where `X' is an integer power of two.
Generally, the larger the page size, the better performance, although
at some point the performance increase becomes insignificant and the
database manager starts to waste memory.  The default of 64 kB should
be a safe compromise, though you might want to use e.g. 16 kB pages on
a slow machine with little memory or with emphasis on real-time
operation rather than thruput.  Conversely, you might use 256 kB on a
contrary case.


	Parametrizing Shades
	--------------------

Before running Shades, you should parametrize it.  Parametrization
means telling Shades how large a database image it should use, where
it should put its disk backup file, etc.

The parametrization in Shades can be done by manipulating the file
`params-def.h' and remaking (depreciated), setting up a resource file
in `libdir/.shadesrc', `~/.shadesrc', or `./.shadesrc', by setting
environment variables, or by giving suitable command line arguments.
Each parameter setting overrides the previous.  Unless overridden with
configure, the default libdir is `/usr/local/hibase/lib'.

For example in order to set the backup file to `/var/shades-db', you
might add the line
	disk_filename=/var/shades-db
in one of the resource files, set the environment variable
`SHADES_DISK_FILENAME' correspondingly, or give the command line
argument `--disk-filename=/var/shades-db'.

A deeper look into the parametrization of Shades is given in the
comments of file `params.h', and the actual parameters, their types
and default values are given in `params-def.h'.

Some parameters must be identical in successful runs of Shades if the
database will be recovered.  In particular `disk_skip_nbytes' must be
identical forever, `disk_filename' can only change if the database
files are changed respectively, and the product


	Running Shades
	--------------

Currently there is no single executable which starts a Shades server,
since not all the functionality of a server-like system has yet been
implemented.  Instead, we have a handful of test programs, each of
which tests a level or a set of features in Shades.

The test programs `test_queue', `test_priq', `test_trie',
`test_triev2', and `test_gc' are dedicated (and constantly changing)
programs to test a specific part of Shades.

`test_tpcb' runs the TPC-B transaction test.  It needs two command
line arguments.  The first argument tells how large the database
should be in terms of official TPC-B database size (1 tps would
require 100 000 account records).  The second argument tells in
seconds for how long the test should be run.

`test_asm' reads the specified byte code assembler file, and calls the
specified byte code sequence with the given argument.  For example, to
run the naive Fibonacci algorithm to compute the 30th Fibonacci
number, issue
	./test_asm test_fib.s fib 30

You should find additional documentation on the assembler files in
each of the assembler files themselves.  All files ending with the
suffix `.s' contain byte code assembler.

In addition to parameters and test program specific command line
arguments, you can usually give `-v' or `--verbose' if you want
verbose output, or `--show-XXX' if you wish to be a little more
selectively verbose.  `XXX' might be e.g. `groups' to show commit
groups, `params' to show parameters, or some test-program specific
option, such as `progress' to show a transaction count for
`test_tpcb'.


	Problems?
	---------

If you get sporadic segmentation faults once the database has been
running for a while, the most probable reasons can be:
  o  You have set (soft or hard) limits on your resource usage.
     See, e.g., `csh's built-in command `limit'.
  o  Your operating system uses lazy swap allocation, and it has just
     run out of virtual memory.
  o  You have found a bug in Shades.  Please report to <cessu@iki.fi>.

Note also, that Shades does not attempt to check the correctness of
the byte code files (as, e.g. Java tries), and therefore corrupt byte
code kills the server.  (We will eventually change this so that only
the offending byte code thread and possibly the commit batch will
fail, but not the whole server.)


	Architecture of Shades
	======================

This Section is not somewhat obsolete, you can read a far better
description of Shades in Kenneth Oksanen's Licentiate's Thesis
	http://hibase.cs.hut.fi/cessu-lic.ps
or its extended version
	http://hibase.cs.hut.fi/cessu-lic-ext.ps


	Fundamental Principles
	----------------------

The very basic, and very pervasive, idea in the index- and interpreter
levels of Shades is that mutations to database objects are done
"copy-on-write".  For example, assume you are about to insert a new
binary tree node as a child of another binary tree node which is
already in the binary tree.  You are not allowed to modify the old
node, so you make a copy of the original node and store in the copied
node the pointer to the new node.  But since the copied node's
location in memory has changed, you have to update also the pointer to
it by performing a copy-on-write update for its parent, and continue
similarly to the root of the binary tree.

At first the strict copy-on-write principle may sound overly
restrictive and cumbersome, but actually an entire programming
culture, the "functional programming" paradigm, is based on the
concept of not allowing mutation.  The functional programming paradigm
is often advocated to improve program readability, correctness and
provability by ensuring "referential transparency".  

Opponents of functional programming criticize it for inefficiency, but
in Shades the very contrary is true.  The copy-on-write policy has
turned out to allow a different, more efficient recovery method.  A
destructive update mechanism that hides the underlying functional
updates would incur a slowdown.

The copy-on-write principle was an elective decision made early in the
algorithmic planning of Shades: it simplifies the recovery method and
allows more "design space" so that garbage collection and many other
useful features have been possible to implement more efficiently than
if we allowed arbitrary mutation anywhere in the database.

(There are only a few carefully selected exceptions to the
copy-on-write rule.  One is in the garbage collector itself.  The
second exception is in the interpreter: only occasionally do we have
to copy the function's activation record when we update or initialize
a local variable or a temporary value.)


	Three Layers
	------------

We assume you are familiar with the most fundamental concepts of
databases and some of the techniques more inclined to main memory
databases.  For an excellent introduction refer to Hector
Garcia-Molina, Kenneth Salem, "Main Memory Database Systems: An
Overview", IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,
Vol. 4, No. 6, December 1992.

Most databases have a layered structure.  Assuming a coarse
three-layer division of a traditional database manager, the lowest
layer performs disk IO, provides media recovery (e.g. by mirroring or
RAID), and crash recovery (e.g. with logs and periodic checkpointing).
The second layer implements index structures (e.g. B-trees) on top of
the primitives provided by the lower level.  The highest level builds
a data model abstraction on top of the index structures, interprets
the query language (e.g. SQL) and discusses with the clients of the
database.

In most traditional disk-based databases the recovery, index, and
concurrency control mechanisms are deeply intertwined, and the
database memory management is incorporated in the query language
interpreter and the index structures.  In Shades, however, the
recovery mechanism includes garbage collection, and the concurrency
control is implemented at a higher level as a set of library routines
in the programming language.  This probably results in a coarser
locking policy and allows less concurrency than the traditional
approach.  On the other hand fine granularity locking is not as
important in main memory databases as it is in disk based databases,
and furthermore Shades provides efficient means for versioning
(snapshots) which can be used to increase concurrency.


	IO, Recoverable Cells, GC
	.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

The IO level of Shades reads and writes data to files and provides
means for small atomic writes and synchronizing the disk write
buffers.  The IO, particularly writes, is done preferably
asynchronously.  The IO level is implemented in files `io.h' and
`io-X.c', where `X' may be e.g. `posix' or `pthreads' depending on
what your operating system supports.  During `configure' a symbolic
link is set from `io.c' to some `io-X.c'.

The basic memory object seen and used by index structures and the
interpreter is called a "cell".  File IO is done in large pages
(cf. `--enable-page-size=X'-option for the `configure' script), but
cells have to be rather small so that copying them is efficient.  If
the cell is very rarely updated, then you may use rather large cells,
theoretically up to a few words less than the page size, but hopefully
not more than e.g. half a kilobyte or 128 words.  A frequently updated
cell should preferably not be larger than eight to twelve words.  The
minimum size of the cell is two words.

The different types of cells have to be described in `cells-def.h' so
that the garbage collector and the recovery algorithm are able to
follow and redirect the pointers in the cells.  See file `cells-def.h'
for documentation and examples.  The files `cells.[hc]' contain useful
macros and routines, e.g. for checking the type of the cell, checking
its correctness, and printing it (and its descendants, if you wish).

The image of the database is one large contiguous array of 32-bit
words.  Since the array can be located in different places in memory,
a "pointer" to a cell in the database is actually the offset of the
cell from the beginning of the array.  The file `shades.h' contains
macros (based on the typedefs in `includes.h') for converting "C-like"
pointers to and from the Shades' notion of pointers.

New cells are allocated from a transient (= volatile, non-recoverable)
region of the database called the "first generation".  When the commit
group is full, the first generation is garbage collected.  The
surviving cells are written to disk and moved to the persistent
(= stable, recoverable) part of the database.  Once some additional
administrative data has also been written to disk, the transactions of
commit group have committed successfully.  Next, if there's need or
excess time, some garbage collection is made also in the persistent
part of the database to make room for future commit groups.  Finally
the first generation is cleared and control resumes to the index
routines or the interpreter.

A fixed handful of pointer and integer variables called the root block
is the only part of the database which is modified in situ, without
copy-on-write.  Consequently modifications to it are not transactional
in the sense that they can be retracted by aborting the transaction (a
sequence of root block manipulations is in fact usually the equivalent
of a commit request).  A cell is not garbage if it referred to by a
pointer in the root block or by another cell which is not garbage.
The root block is written atomically at the very end of the group
commit to a distinct position on disk and read from there in the
beginning of recovery.  The root block is defined in `root-def.h' and
some related tools are defined in `root.[hc]'.

One final crux: the garbage collector moves cells and it redirects
pointers within the database accordingly, but it is totally ignorant
of any pointers from C code to the database.  Therefore the programmer
must ensure that all cells that should not be collected away exist in
the transitive closure of cells starting from the handful of pointers
in the root block.  After garbage collection the C-pointers have to be
updated from the database pointers.  In practice most, currently all,
index operations and byte code primitives are atomic, so the above
problem is not a considerable cause of concern.  The byte code
interpreter, however, being the "main event loop" of the whole
database system can not be atomic and has therefore been carefully
crafted to cope with this issue.  Additionally some test programs have
to pay close attention to this.

The allocation of cells is done by the function `allocate'.  Checking
that the allocation will succeed must be done prior to allocation by
the function `can_allocate'.  The commit group is finished and garbage
is collected by the function `flush_batch' and the functions it uses.
See the latter part of file `shades.h' for further documentation and
some additional tools.  The actual implementation is in file
`shades.c'.


	Index Structures
	.  .  .  .  .  .

The files `list.[hc]' implement the very familiar LISP-like linked
lists and the basic tools, such as `CAR', `CDR', and `CONS'.

The FIFO queue implementation of files `queue.[hc]' is based on Robert
Hood, Robert Melville, "Real-Time Queue Operations in Pure LISP",
Information Processing Letters, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1981, pp. 50-54.

Probably the most frequently used index structure in Shades is the
path- and width-compressing 4-way trie implemented in `triev2.[hc]'.

Leaf-oriented AVL-trees are implemented in `avl.[hc]'.  These routines
come in two flavors depending on whether the key comparison function
is a C-function or a byte code function.

Priority queues based on binomial heaps are implemented in
`priq.[hc]'.

Most (currently all) index structures are atomic, and assume they can
allocate the amount of memory they need.  To ensure the index
operations will succeed, the caller must test `can_allocate(X)' prior
to the index operation call, and issue `flush_batch' if `can_allocate'
failed.  The number `X' is the number of words the index operation
will allocate in the worst case.  Typically the maximum allocation of
index operation `Y' or any operation on the index `Y' is called
`Y_MAX_ALLOCATION'.


	Byte Code Interpreter
	.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

As much as Shades is a main memory database, it is also a persistent
programming language.  The application programmer's code is compiled
to byte code, which can then be read in to the Shades database server
and executed there by a byte code interpreter.

The assembler is implemented in the files `asm*': `asm_lex.l' is the
lex-source for the lexer, `asm_parse.y' the yacc-source for the
parser, `asm.c' contains numerous routines that actually build (and
optimize) the byte code sequence, `asm_defs.h' contains definitions
internal to the assembler, and `asm.h' exports the interface to the
rest of Shades.

(Unlike Java, the byte code assembler does not (yet?) even attempt to
check the correctness or safety of the byte code programs.  Probably
in future a better byte code assembler will be rewritten in some other
language and compiled to byte code itself, and the role of the current
byte code assembler becomes a mere bootstrap loader.)

The interpreter is based on byte code instead of an abstract syntax
tree representation of the program because byte code is somewhat
(perhaps twice?) faster and because context switching between byte
code threads is easier than in a recursive tree evaluation.

Continuation passing, closure passing style (CPS) is another technique
applied extensively in the interpreter.  Refer to e.g. Andrew Appel,
"Compiling with Continuations", Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992.  The
activation records of continuations construct a linked list as in
Appel's SML/NJ and as described in the beginning of Robert Hieb, Kent
Dybvig, Carl Bruggeman, "Representing Control in the Presence of First
Class Continuations", SIGPLAN'90, pp. 66-77.  (The stack-based
continuation frame allocation presented in that paper is not used
because it is not suitable for the allocation strategy of Shades.)

The interpreter is implemented in file `interp.c' and the byte code
instructions are defined in `insn-def.h'.

Note that the interpreter's data structures (byte codes, continuation
frames, etc.) are also stored in the database.  Therefore they attain
all the basic properties of any other data in the database.  In
particular, interpreted byte code programs are garbage collected,
recoverable, and eventually also replicatable and migratable!

In terms of efficiency, the byte code interpreter of Shades is
competitive with other byte code interpreters although Shades' byte
code processes are persistent!  We presume that for traditional
database queries the overhead of the byte code interpreter will not be
a serious cause of concern, e.g. in the TPC-B benchmark the overhead
of the byte code interpreter is only 10-15%.

	Naming
	.  .  .

Spaces in names are represented by underscores.

Macros and enumerated values are usually fully capitalized,
i.e. `THIS_IS_A_MACRO'.  Some exceptions do occur, usually for sake of
compatibility.

Variables and functions are written with lower case letters,
i.e. `this_is_a_function', `this_is_a_variable'.

Type names are written with lower case letters and they end with `_t'.

There is no dedicated boolean type, instead use type `int' so that 0
designates false or "no error" and any non-zero, not necessarily 1,
value designates true or the error number.

Variables and functions with truth-value semantics are named as
intransitive statements of the fact.  For example,
	db_is_recovered
	can_allocate
	is_in_first_generation
	must_print_data

Functions that construct something or change the state of the program,
are named with transitive phrases.  For example,
	allocate
	clear_first_generation
	notify_page_change
	print_data
Only occasionally is the verb omitted; most notably in conversion
functions/macros the verb `convert' is omitted as obvious.
	WORD_TO_PTR
Similarly the verb `get' may sometimes be omitted as naïve.
	CELL_TYPE

Note also that there's a subtle difference in how these values are
interpreted, particularly in if-conditions.  For truth-valued values,
	if (!must_print_data)
	  ...
and respectively for other data,
	if (strcmp(s, "foo") == 0)
          ...

Variables that contain data are usually named rather verbosely.  For
example,
	first_generation_start
	list_of_free_pages
	number_of_free_pages

Occasionally the auxiliary verb "do" is used to denote that the
function is in fact the actual implementor, and there's a similarly
named public front-end function that may, e.g., hide some parameter
initializations.  For example,
	cell_do_fprint	(the actual implementation)
	cell_fprint	(the public front-end)

There's no strict tendency to module-wise name prefixing.  It is
practiced only where it has been convenient, e.g. in `io.[hc]'.

It is known that the current practice in naming may lead, or leads, to
name clashes with some system's headers or some rather widely used
software packages and libraries (such as Tcl/Tk, X11, f2c, p2c, etc.)
For the time being we have deliberately chosen to ignore this name
space pollution in favor of a more free and descriptive naming style.
There's no problem in fixing the name clashes afterwards with a
handful of trivial scripts.
